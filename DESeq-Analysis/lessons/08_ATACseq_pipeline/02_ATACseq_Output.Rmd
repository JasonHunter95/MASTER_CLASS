# GOAL to explore the output files from the ATACseq pipeline !
Congratulations, if you are here it means you have completed your 
ATACseq pipeline run !

Now let's look through the results step by step !

# (1) QC analysis
There is a multiqc .html report - transfer to your comp and open - it's here:
08_ATACseq/00_run_pipeline/00_pipeline_run/<YOUR_PIPELINE_OUTPUT>/multiqc/broad_peak

# Look through and answer these questions:
- How many reads per sample?


- Did the X or Y chromosome get more reads mapped?
The X chromosome is larger than the Y chromosome, so it is expected to have more reads mapped.
This is shown in MERGED LIB: SAMTools (filtered) XY counts section.

- what was roughly the average insert size (size of DNA from ATACseq)?
The rough average insert size across your ATAC-seq data is approximately 75-100 base pairs,
with a strong enrichment around ~50 bp consistent with open chromatin.


- what can you conclude from the "Read Distribution Profile after Annotation"?
This shows strong TSS enrichment, indicating that the ATAC-seq peaks are enriched around transcription start sites (TSS) of genes.

* MACS2 section has a bunch of cool results:
- How many peaks were called (estimate)?
Approximately ~900,000 peaks in total across all samples.

- What percentage of reads were inside peaks?
    - hint: FRiP score
    - what do you make of this?
The data quality is highest in KO samples, especially ESC_KO_control_90_REP1.
Some WT replicates may benefit from further filtering or re-sequencing for sharper signal.

    
- What type of annotation (HOMER) did most peaks land on?
The majority of peaks are annotated as either “intron” or “promoter-TSS”.
Together, intron + promoter-TSS peaks account for ~70-75% of all annotations — a strong signal of meaningful chromatin accessibility in regulatory regions.

- Which category do you think has the smallest genome space but most peaks considering ...?
Promoter-TSS regions occupy the smallest proportion of the genome yet harbor one of the highest densities of ATAC-seq peaks —
a hallmark of well-targeted, biologically relevant chromatin accessibility data.

- The PCA plot tells you how similar the samples are to each other
    - There is an important trend that maybe of CONCERN?
There's strong sample separation along PC1 — potentially biological or technical.
This can be verified with sample metadata to determine
if the separation is due to biological differences (e.g., time points) or technical artifacts (e.g., batch effects).
    
- Interestingly the heat map doesn't look as bad as the PCA plot.
    - red means smaller distance or more similar.
- If you had to say there are two trends, how many samples in each category?
There appear to be two main clusters, each with 6 samples, likely representing:

Group 1: KO (top-left block)

Group 2: WT (bottom-right block)

This supports that biological condition (KO vs WT) is a major source of variation — consistent with what we suspected from the PCA.

# (2) RESULTS - Raw Data (BigWig) !
In your pipeline output directory there is a folder called BWA.
This has the key results we need.

Follow these steps and answer the questions along the way !

- Transfer "bigwig" files to your computer to look at with IGV.
- Find 2 good examples of peaks 
    - (hint your peak file is in MACS2 > BroadPeak > Consensus folder - )
    - good examples would be peak in all samples or one changing by time


# (3) RESULTS -MACS2 (Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Seq))

Go to the consensus folder and transfer "intersect.plot.pdf" only PDF in folder
Try and understand the plot.

What sample has the most unique number of peaks for just that sample.
Which two have the most peaks in common
How many peaks are in all samples?

Explore even more in IGV or in the result output and enjoy !

########### Thought ExeRcise ###########  

# (1) What are consensus peaks and how are they made by MACS2?

# (2) What research questions could we ask with the consensus peaks?

# (3) Look up Broad Peak / Narrow Peak / gapped peak 

# Hint: Use ChatGPT :) just make sure to use MACS2 in prompt !

Next we will move on to explore where the peaks are in the genome
and how they compare across time points.
